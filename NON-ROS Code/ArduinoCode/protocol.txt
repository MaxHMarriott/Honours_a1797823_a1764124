The chosen protocol will be as follows:

Trial 0: No LEDS on
Trial 1: Zone 1 (High), Zone 3 (Low)
Trial 2: Zone 2 (Medium), Zone 3 (High)
Trial 3: Zone 4 (Medium), Zone 1 (Medium)
Trial 4: Zone 2 (Low), Zone 1 (High)
Trial 5: Zone 4 (Low), Zone 3 (Medium)

These will correspond to the Arduino System as 0-5 over the serial line.
